#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)

`n` to the 3rd power compared to adding `a = a + n * n`,
will run `n` times before `a` will be greater than or equal to `n` to the 3rd power.
Therefore, this is a linear formula. The runtime grows at the same rate as the input.

b) O(c^n)

As the input grows the runtime is growing at a much faster rate. 
if `n` is 2 this will run twice, however if `n` is 100 it'll run 700 times and if `n` is 200 it'll fun 1600 times. 

c) O(n)

This function is resursive and will run back on itself `n` times until you have 0 bunnies. 
Therefore, this is a linear formula. The runtime grows at the same rate as the input.
